# Using Raku to scrape and analyze Ukraine Ministry of Defense Data

News about combat losses of the Russian invaders are periodically published 
by the [Ukraininan minister of Defense](https://www.mil.gov.ua/en/news/) 
This is a [Raku](https://raku.org) module that extracts information from 
those pages, for instance [this one](https://www.mil.gov.
ua/en/news/2022/06/05/the-total-combat-losses-of-the-enemy-from-24-02-to-05-06/).

Failed tests for scraping are included in the `bin` directory. `scrapy.py` is
 functional, you will need to install the corresponding Python and Chrome
  dependencies.

* Download `chromedriver` from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). You'll need to copy it by hand to
 the directory in the script, or anywhere else and change the script too
 . Please bear in mind that there are specific `chromedriver` binaries for
  every version of Chrome; they need to be exactly the same.

The raw content of the pages used as source is included in the [`raw-pages
` directory](raw-pages/), mainly for
 caching purposes. They are (c) the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the
  source is [this page](https://www.mil.gov.ua/en/news/).
