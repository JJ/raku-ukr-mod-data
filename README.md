# Using Raku to scrape and analyze Ukraine Ministry of Defense Data

News about combat losses of the Russian invaders are periodically published 
by the [Ukraininan minister of Defense](https://www.mil.gov.ua/en/news/) 
This is a [Raku](https://raku.org) module that extracts information from 
those pages, for instance [this one](https://www.mil.gov.
ua/en/news/2022/06/05/the-total-combat-losses-of-the-enemy-from-24-02-to-05-06/).

> Note: the English one is updated less frequently than the [Ukrainian one](https://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2022/06/08/vid-pochatku-povnomasshtabnoi-vijni-proti-ukraini-rosiya-vtratila-uzhe-1393-tanki-znishheno-703-artilerijskih-sistemi-voroga-%E2%80%93-generalnij-shtab-zs-ukraini/)
> At least there's a 2 day delay. I can't figure the later, unfortunately
